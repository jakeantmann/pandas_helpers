## Initialise dev

- Clone repo
- Run `source ./config/dev-init.sh` from within the root repo directory. This updates pip, installs all required packages (including those required for dev), and installs pre-commit.
  - Note: Some pre-commit hooks are shell scripts, so use linux when developing this package.
